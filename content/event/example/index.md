summary: My talk on 2021 NCTS Young Dynamics Day.
abstract: "The studies of shift spaces on a Cayley-trees are sprouting in the recent years. One reason for this lies in its physical significance such as Ising model on Cayley-trees, on which the investigations of Gibbs measure are conducted. As Gibbs measure for shift spaces on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ reaches the maximal entropy, i.e., the topological entropy, it is of our interest to study a generalization of topological entropy on Cayley-trees. Current literatures demonstrate successful attempt to this end on the free groups and free semigroups. In this work, we consider the the topological entropy on a collection of finitely generated semigroups whose Cayley graphs are trees. In particular, this collection includes the free groups. Based on the idea of stem entropy and graph representation introduced in this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of limit in the topological entropy and reveal the coincidence of topological entropy and stem entropy. These results are further supplemented by the algorithms of the numerical calculation of entropy for shifts of finite type."
