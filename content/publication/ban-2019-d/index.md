abstract: Motivated from the study of multiple ergodic average, the investigation
  of multiplicative shift spaces has drawn much of interest among researchers. This
  paper focuses on the relation of topologically mixing properties between multiplicative
  shift spaces and traditional shift spaces. Suppose that $\Omega^(l)$ is the multiplicative
  subshift derived from the shift space $\Omega$ with given $l > 1$. We show that $\Omega^(l)$
  is (topologically) transitive/mixing if and only if $\Omega$ is extensible/mixing.
  After introducing $l$-directional mixing property, we derive the equivalence between
  $l$-directional mixing property of $\Omega^(l)$ and weakly mixing property of $\Omega$.
