abstract: We reveal an algorithm for determining the complete prefix code irreducibility
  (CPC-irreducibility) of dyadic trees labeled by a finite alphabet. By introducing
  an extended directed graph representation of tree shift of finite type (TSFT), we
  show that the CPC-irreducibility of TSFTs is related to the connectivity of its
  graph representation, which is a similar result to one-dimensional shifts of finite
  type.
