abstract: We study the topological entropy of hom tree-shifts and show that, although
  the topological entropy is not conjugacy invariant for tree-shifts in general, it
  remains invariant for hom tree higher block shifts. In doi:10.1016/j.tcs.2018.05.034
  and doi:10.3934/dcds.2020186, Petersen and Salama demonstrated the existence of
  topological entropy for tree-shifts and $h(mathcalT_X) ≥ h(X)$, where $mathcalT_X$
  is the hom tree-shift derived from $X$. We characterize a necessary and sufficient
  condition when the equality holds for the case where $X$ is a shift of finite type.
  In addition, two novel phenomena have been revealed for tree-shifts. There is a
  gap in the set of topological entropy of hom tree-shifts of finite type, which makes
  such a set not dense. Last but not least, the topological entropy of a reducible
  hom tree-shift of finite type is equal to or larger than that of its maximal irreducible
  component.
